# Code-Quiz
This week goal aims to create a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so 
that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.
This dynamic and responsive quiz with the fundamental Javascript, CSS.
In this multi-choice quiz, you'll be shown the quiz description on the first page which states the rule of the quiz.
When you start the quiz, the 50 seconds timer starts running as well.

when your answer is incorrect, it will display "incorrect" and will be subtracting 5 seconds 
after answering all five questions you will be asked for your initial to store your scores.
